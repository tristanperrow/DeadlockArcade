# Deadlock Arcade

A Deadlock Mod that adds an **Arcade** button to the main deadlock page, where you can play some games inbetween your long queue times!

## Currently Available Games

- **Viper**: A snake clone
- **Pong**: A pong clone
- **Guided Owl**: A flappy bird clone

These games are all a work in progress, and will be more polished with textures, ui, and sounds before more games are released.

## Installation

Use other guides for installing mods, and just insert `pak95_dir.vpk` into the spot where you put other mods!
I will flesh out this guide later, just writing this for a placeholder.
